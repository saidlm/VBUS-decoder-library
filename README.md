# VBUS-decoder-library

The aim of the project is to create libraty which open way to decode VBUS communication on VBUS. VBUS is point-to-multipoint communication environment define by RESOL.

The primary reason why the project has been started is to decode information from Solar regulator form Viessmann - Vitosolic 200.

Curent version 1.0 is decoding data from temperature sensors, pupms power and state of relays.
