# VBUS-decoder-library

The aim of the project is to create library which open way to decode VBUS communication on VBUS. VBUS is point-to-multipoint communication environment define by RESOL.

The primary reason why the project has been started is to decode information from Solar regulator from Viessmann - Vitosolic 200. However, the way to add any new devices is open and is pretty easy.

Curent version 1.0 is decoding data from temperature sensors, pupms power and state of relays.
